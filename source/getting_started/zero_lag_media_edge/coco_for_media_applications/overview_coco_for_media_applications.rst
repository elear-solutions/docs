Overview
========

The COCO Media SDK provides API's to develop End-User Client Applications which allow users to create and conduct Media Calls with multiple participants in them. Video and Audio can be exchanged between participants, in addition to sharing Third Party OTT content such as a movie, a live sports broadcast or a song.

Upcoming support is planned for sharing other types of content such as text and files, and to implement restrictions such as the no. of participants in a call.
