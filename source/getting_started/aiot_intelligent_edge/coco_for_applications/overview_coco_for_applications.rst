Overview
========

The COCO Application SDK's provides API's to develop the following types of Applications:

#. End-User Client Applications, providing end-users with User Interface-driven features to interface with COCO Devices to control resources or receive data from them, as well as exchange messages with other COCO Clients.
#. Headless Client Applications, similar to End-User Client Applications, except that they run without a User Interface and perform back-end functions in a system, such as deriving inferences from COCO Resource Attribute data using Machine Learning algorithms.
#. Ecosystem Bridge Applications, to connect COCO Devices and Applications to external systems like the Tuya Cloud platform, or Voice Assistants like Google Home & Alexa.
#. Analytics Client Applications, to access summarized data provided by our AIoT platform based on aggregated COCO Resource Attribute data.

The following COCO Application SDK's are used to support the above types of applications:

#. COCO Client SDK, used for developing End-User or Headless Client Applications, as well as Ecosystem Bridge Applications.
#. COCO Analytics SDK, used for developing Single-page Analytics Web Apps with User Interfaces to present summarized COCO Resource Attribute data.
