Suggestion from Ashish - Use Cases: You can use the Device SDK to connect your devices to the Real-Time Internet. Comes in 2 flavors: COCO SDK (used by Linux Based devices like Gateways, Cameras, Robots, Drones, etc.) and the COCO Bean SDK used for resource constrained devices like Micro Controllers with WiFi. Also note that COCO Bean is coming soon on FreeRTOS.>
