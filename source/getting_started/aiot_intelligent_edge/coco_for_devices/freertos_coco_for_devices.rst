FreeRTOS (coming soon!)
=======================

Watch this space!

The upcoming COCO Bean SDK will be a C library for the FreeRTOS operating system. It will enable Microcontrollers and other memory/compute/power constrained devices behind appliances (such as Light Bulbs) or sensors to get Buzzed-on-COCO. In other words, they can become COCO Devices that provide control or data reporting features by implementing one or more capabilities in the :ref:`coco_standard`.
