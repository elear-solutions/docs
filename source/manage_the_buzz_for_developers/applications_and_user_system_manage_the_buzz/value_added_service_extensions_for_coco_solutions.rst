Value-Added Service Extensions for COCO Solutions
=================================================
These can be used by the developers to create apps for integrations or
extending the functionality of the existing solutions based on the COCO
Platform. For example, various apps can be developed based on COCO Home
Solution like Voice Integration with COCO Home, custom analytics app,
etc. Here, the end user authorizes the application to access his/her
COCONets from the user's COCO account.
